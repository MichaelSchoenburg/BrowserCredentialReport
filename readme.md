This script returns a semicolon delimited table of all credentials saved in Internet Explorer, Edge, Chrome or Firefox as text in the console using tools from Nir Soft.

The script is intended solely for legal use.
Script runs fully automatic. No input needed. Output comes in form of text (csv) since it is meant to be used in remote monitoring and management solutions.

I don't want to host Nir Soft software on my repo so you'll have to download them yourself. But you can then use Get-Bytes.ps1 and embedd the executable files inside the script -- that you would only do once.
